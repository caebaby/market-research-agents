"I'm continuing work on my Market Research Agents project. Please review the uploaded files for full context. 

Current status: Just fixed the context-analysis function and testing with real client data (Axiom Planning Resources). 

My coding level: Elementary - need complete code blocks and step-by-step instructions.

Immediate goal: Validate our reasoning agent produces professional-grade insights from comprehensive business context."
# PROJECT STATE SUMMARY - Market Research Agents
*Last Updated: June 14, 2025*

## üöÄ CURRENT STATUS

### ‚úÖ **WORKING COMPONENTS**
- **Comprehensive Form**: Deployed at `/test-form` with professional UI

- **Backend Processing**: `/research/context-analysis` endpoint functional
- **Reasoning Agent**: Connected via `reasoning_agent_call()` function
- **Session Management**: Tracking research sessions and results
- **GitHub Integration**: Auto-deployment from commits working

### üîß **JUST COMPLETED**
- **Fixed Import Error**: Replaced `run_reasoning_icp_research` with existing `reasoning_agent_call()`
- **Form Upgrade**: Converted from multi-field form to comprehensive single-box
- **Enhanced UI**: Professional reasoning agent branding and loading states
- **Model Addition**: Added `SimpleBusinessContext` BaseModel
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive context documentation

### üß™ **CURRENTLY TESTING**
- **Real Client Data**: Testing with Axiom Planning Resources business context
- **Reasoning Agent Output**: Validating quality of comprehensive context analysis
- **Deployment Status**: Recent fix deploying (waiting for completion)

## üèóÔ∏è SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### **Repository**: `caebaby/market-research-agents`
### **Main Components**:
- `main.py` - FastAPI application with endpoints
- `agents/icp_intelligence_agent.py` - Core reasoning agent
- Deployed on Render with auto-deployment

### **Key Functions**:
```python
# Form endpoint
@app.get("/test-form") 
async def comprehensive_research_form()

# Processing endpoint  
@app.post("/research/context-analysis")
async def context_analysis_research(context: SimpleBusinessContext)

# Core reasoning function
reasoning_agent_call(prompt)  # From icp_intelligence_agent.py
```

### **Data Models**:
```python
class BusinessContext(BaseModel):  # Original multi-field model
class SimpleBusinessContext(BaseModel):  # New comprehensive context model
    comprehensive_context: str
```

## üéØ REAL WORLD TEST CASE

### **Client**: Axiom Planning Resources
**Business**: Back office support for financial advisors
**Target Market**: Mid-career advisors (5-10 years exp, age 30-55, stuck <$150K)
**Offering**: 4-pillar Axiom Method (MODEL, CULTURE, RESOURCES, NETWORK)
**Goals**: Double from 100 to 200 advisors through systematic marketing

**Test Context**:
```
Company: Axiom Planning Resources provides "back office" support and resources to financial advisors so they can focus on growing their practice. Founded by Jerry and Chas, they operate with the highest integrity and prioritize doing what's best for clients over profits. Currently have 100 advisors, aiming to double to 200.

Offering: The Axiom Method with 4 pillars:
1. MODEL: Shift from commission yo-yo business to recurring fee-based revenue
2. CULTURE: Client-centric culture focused on doing what's best for clients
3. RESOURCES: Remove barriers by providing all resources needed for advisors to focus on advising and attracting high-net-worth clients  
4. NETWORK: Connect with 100+ top-producing advisors, ending isolation through mentorship

Marketing Goal: Recruit more financial advisors through systematic marketing approach, including "Top One Percent Advisor Podcast" and content funnels.

Target Market: Financial advisors aged 30-55 with 5-10 years experience who are stuck and frustrated with current practice growth. Particularly those forced to hit sales numbers regardless of client benefit.

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL DETAILS

### **URLs**:
- **Live Form**: https://market-research-agents.onrender.com/test-form
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/caebaby/market-research-agents
- **Main File**: https://github.com/caebaby/market-research-agents/blob/main/main.py

### **Recent Code Changes**:
1. **Added Model** (near line 20):
```python
class SimpleBusinessContext(BaseModel):
    comprehensive_context: str
```

2. **Replaced Form Function** (around line 123):
- Upgraded from multi-field to single comprehensive text box
- Enhanced UI with reasoning agent branding

3. **Fixed Processing Function**:
- **CHANGED**: `reasoning_results = run_reasoning_icp_research(enhanced_context)`
- **TO**: `reasoning_results = reasoning_agent_call(f"Analyze this comprehensive business context...")`

### **Deployment Process**:
- Commit to GitHub ‚Üí Auto-deploy on Render (5-10 minutes)
- Changes take effect automatically
- Monitor deployment status in Render dashboard

## üéì MY LEARNING PREFERENCES

### **Communication Style**:
- **Elementary Level**: I'm new to coding, explain like teaching a beginner
- **Complete Code**: Provide full code blocks, not snippets
- **Step-by-Step**: Break down tasks into simple numbered steps
- **Exact Instructions**: Tell me exactly where to click, what to copy/paste

### **Examples of Good Instructions**:
‚úÖ "Go to GitHub ‚Üí Click main.py ‚Üí Click pencil icon ‚Üí Search for [exact text] ‚Üí Replace entire function with [complete code]"
‚úÖ "Copy this ENTIRE code block and paste it exactly where the old function was"
‚úÖ "Don't change anything else, just replace this one line"

### **Examples of Confusing Instructions**:
‚ùå "Modify the function to use the existing agent"
‚ùå "Update the import statement"  
‚ùå "Make these changes to the endpoint"

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING HISTORY

### **Recent Issues Solved**:
1. **Import Error**: `name 'run_reasoning_icp_research' is not defined`
   - **Solution**: Used existing `reasoning_agent_call()` function instead
   - **Location**: `/research/context-analysis` endpoint

2. **Form Complexity**: Multi-field form too limited for comprehensive context
   - **Solution**: Single-box comprehensive context input
   - **Result**: Users can paste detailed business information like ChatGPT

### **Error Patterns**:
- Import errors usually mean function name mismatch
- Deployment errors require waiting 5-10 minutes after commits
- JavaScript fetch errors usually indicate backend problems, not frontend

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### **Priority 1**: Test Real Client Data
- Wait for deployment completion
- Submit Axiom Planning context through form
- Validate reasoning agent output quality

### **Priority 2**: Evaluate Results
- Review depth and accuracy of insights
- Check for actionable recommendations
- Assess professional consulting quality

### **Priority 3**: System Optimization  
- Improve reasoning agent prompts if needed
- Enhance result presentation format
- Consider additional output features

## üìã CONTEXT FOR NEW CHATS

### **If Starting New Chat**:
1. **Upload this file** + main.py + comprehensive context docs
2. **Current Status**: "We just fixed the context-analysis function and are testing with real client data"
3. **Immediate Goal**: "Validate the reasoning agent produces high-quality insights from comprehensive business context"
4. **My Skill Level**: "Elementary coding knowledge - need complete code blocks and step-by-step instructions"

### **Current Test Question**:
"Does our reasoning agent produce professional-grade market research insights when given comprehensive business context vs. simple form fields?"

### **Success Criteria**:
- Deep customer psychology insights
- Actionable marketing recommendations  
- Voice of customer language capture
- Professional consulting-level analysis quality

## üèÜ PROJECT VISION

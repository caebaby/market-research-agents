            TACTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            
            1. HEADLINE TEST VARIATIONS (8 different angles)
            For each headline provide:
            - The headline copy
            - Psychological trigger used
            - Target audience segment 
            - Success hypothesis (what response you expect)
            - Test budget recommendation ($25-50)
            - Success metrics (CTR%, CPM targets)
            
            2. HOOK-STORY-OFFER MICRO-TESTS (5 variations)
            For each provide:
            - Pattern interrupt hook (first 3 seconds)
            - Relatable story setup (seconds 4-8)
            - Clear offer/CTA (seconds 9-15)
            - Audience targeting suggestion
            - Expected cost per result
            
            3. SCROLL-STOPPING ANGLES (6 variations)
            Test these psychological angles:
            - Authority contradiction ("Everyone says X, but...")
            - Social proof specificity ("87% of [specific group]...")
            - Future pacing ("Imagine if...")
            - Problem agitation ("The real reason you...")

            4. MICRO-TEST SUCCESS FRAMEWORK
            - Target CTR: 2.5%+ for cold traffic
            - Target CPM: Under $15
            - Target CPC: Under $2
            - Conversion rate expectation: 3-8%
            - Budget per test: $25-50
            - Test duration: 3-5 days
            
            Use exact customer language from research. Make each test hypothesis crystal clear.

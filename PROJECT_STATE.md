# PROJECT STATE: Market Research Agents
*Last Updated: June 30, 2025*

## 🎯 PROJECT VISION
Transform market research from multi-week consulting engagements into sophisticated 5-minute AI-powered analysis using a team of autonomous agents that conduct deep customer research, simulate interviews, analyze competitors, and produce professional-grade GTM strategies.

## 📍 CURRENT STATUS: Where We Are Now

### ✅ **WORKING COMPONENTS**
- **Structured Research Form** (`/research`): Professional 14-field form capturing comprehensive business context
- **Basic Agent Processing**: Single reasoning agent (`reasoning_agent_call`) processing inputs
- **Session Management**: Tracking research sessions with results storage
- **GitHub → Render Pipeline**: Auto-deployment working smoothly
- **Form Submission**: Context properly formatted and sent to backend

### 🏗️ **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**
```
Current Flow:
User → /research form → /research/context-analysis → reasoning_agent_call() → Results

Built but Not Connected:
- avatar_agnostic_coordinator.py
- dynamic_interview_agent.py  
- marketing_intelligence_synthesizer.py
```

### 📊 **DEPLOYMENT STATUS**
- **Repository**: github.com/caebaby/market-research-agents
- **Live URL**: https://market-research-agents.onrender.com
- **Form URL**: https://market-research-agents.onrender.com/research
- **Platform**: Render (auto-deploy on commit)

- [ ] Downloadable PDF reports
- [ ] Email delivery system
- [ ] Results dashboard

### PHASE 5: Scale & Optimize 📋 Not Started
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Caching mechanisms
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Usage analytics
- [ ] API endpoint creation

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### 1. **Validate Current System** (Today)
- [ ] Test form with Axiom Planning Resources data
- [ ] Verify output quality meets professional standards
- [ ] Document any issues or gaps
- [ ] Confirm reasoning agent produces actionable insights

### 2. **Fix Agent Connections** (This Week)
- [ ] Review avatar_agnostic_coordinator.py code
- [ ] Identify why coordinator isn't connecting
- [ ] Map out agent communication flow
- [ ] Create simple test for multi-agent setup
- [ ] Enable coordinator with proper error handling

### 3. **Activate Interview Simulation** (This Week)
- [ ] Connect dynamic_interview_agent.py
- [ ] Test avatar interview simulation
- [ ] Ensure voice-of-customer authenticity
- [ ] Validate interview insights quality

### 4. **Complete Agent Team** (Next Week)
- [ ] Enable marketing synthesis agent
- [ ] Test full agent pipeline
- [ ] Verify end-to-end flow
- [ ] Optimize coordination timing

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & BLOCKERS

### Current Issues:
1. **Multi-agent coordination disabled** - Coordinator commented out
2. **Agent imports failing** - Mismatch between expected and actual function names
3. **No visual output** - Results shown as raw JSON
4. **No competitor analysis** - Agent exists but not integrated

### Technical Debt:
- Inconsistent agent initialization patterns
- Missing error handling in agent communication
- No retry logic for failed agent tasks
- Limited logging for debugging

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

### Quality Benchmarks:
- [ ] ICP insights depth: 85%+ confidence
- [ ] Customer language authenticity: 90%+ realistic
- [ ] Interview simulation quality: Indistinguishable from real interviews
- [ ] Marketing recommendations: Immediately actionable
- [ ] Processing time: Under 5 minutes

### User Success Criteria:
- [ ] Replace 40+ hours of consultant research
- [ ] Produce McKinsey-quality insights
- [ ] Generate ready-to-use GTM strategies
- [ ] Capture authentic voice-of-customer
- [ ] Identify non-obvious market opportunities

## 🎓 PROJECT CONTEXT FOR AI ASSISTANTS

When continuing work on this project:

1. **Current State**: Single agent working, multi-agent system built but not connected
2. **Immediate Priority**: Enable the coordinator to orchestrate all agents
3. **User Skill Level**: Elementary coding - provide complete code blocks and exact instructions
4. **Architecture Pattern**: CrewAI-based multi-agent system with sequential processing
5. **Deployment**: GitHub → Render auto-deploy (changes live in 5-10 minutes)

### Sample Instructions Format:
✅ "Go to line 247 in main.py and replace the entire function with this code: [complete code block]"
❌ "Update the coordinator initialization"

## 🚀 LONG-TERM VISION

### 6-Month Goals:
- 100+ businesses using the platform
- 95%+ satisfaction on research quality
- Sub-2-minute processing time
- Industry-specific agent specializations
- White-label offering for agencies

### Revolutionary Impact:
- Democratize enterprise-grade market research
- Enable solopreneurs to compete with big consultancies  
- Accelerate go-to-market from months to days
- Create AI-native research methodology
- Build the "Bloomberg Terminal" for market intelligence
